      <p>My name is Pawan Kumar, and I have been serving as an Assistant Professor at IIIT Hyderabad since 2017. I lead the OPTIMAL group, a collaborative team comprising mathematicians and computer scientists dedicated to designing provably fast optimization and machine learning algorithms.

      Our work revolves around developing fast and robust algorithms through deep mathematical insights and innovative algorithmic designs. Specifically, we leverage numerical analysis and advanced data structures to create algorithms optimized for modern computing architectures, such as GPUs, FPGAs, and clusters. Our research bridges scientific computing and machine learning, emphasizing the synergy between robust numerical methods and high-performance computing.

      I actively welcome bright undergraduate and graduate students with strong skills in mathematics, Python programming, or high-performance computing. Students from non-CS backgrounds who are passionate about intersecting scientific computing with machine learning are also encouraged to reach out.
