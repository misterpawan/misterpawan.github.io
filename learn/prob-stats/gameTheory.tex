\begin{itemize}
\item If both of them do not confess, they serve 2 years each \pause 
\item If they confess to crime, partner does not, then person confessing will be granted immunity. However, in this case the partner not confessing will serve 10 years \pause 
\item If both confess, then both end up spending 5 years each in jail \pause 
\item Given that Wanda and Fred have no reason to trust, what is the good option? 
\end{itemize}

\item Indeed, if both don't confess, \pause then it is \yellow{best} for them; \pause 2 years each! \pause 
\item But another best option is when they both confess. Because in other cases, one of then has to spend 10 years in jail \pause 
\item This is part of \yellow{co-operative games}, and $5/5$ is called \yellow{Nash equilibrium}
\item These topics are part of topic known as \yellow{game theory} (John Nash!)
